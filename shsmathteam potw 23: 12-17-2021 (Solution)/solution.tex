\textbf{Solution}\textbf{:}\V

Let $C = AP\cap BQ$. Noting that $R$ is the orthocenter of $ABC$, it suffices to prove that $C$ lies on the altitude from $C$. Since $TQOP$ is the nine point circle, with diameter $TO$, it is well known that $T$ is the midpoint of $CR$ (the $C$-Euler point), which implies the result.
