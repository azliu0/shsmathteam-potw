Imagine that there are 100 passengers trying to board a commercial flight headed to eulerâ€™s oil refinery. The first passenger forgets his designated seat, so he sits in a random one; one by one the other passengers try to sit in their own seat; if its taken, they sit in a random open seat. What is the chance that the 100th passenger in line gets their own seat?
