\textit{Geometry}\V

Convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ has $AB = 18, \angle{A} = 60^{\circ}$, and $\overline{AB} \parallel \overline{CD}$. In some order, the lengths of the four sides form an arithmetic progression, and side $\overline{AB}$ is a side of maximum length. The length of another side is $a$. What is the sum of all possible values of $a$?
