\textit{Geometry}\V

Let $\mathcal{E}$ be an ellipse with a major axis of length $10$. Circle $\omega$ with center $O$ is tangent to $\mathcal{E}$ at $P$. The line $OP$ intersects the major and minor axes of $\mathcal{E}$ at $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Suppose that $PX=4$ and $PY=6$. Find the distance between the foci of $\mathcal{E}$.
